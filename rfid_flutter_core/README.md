`rfid_flutter_core` is the foundational core package for the RFID Flutter plugin architecture, providing essential interfaces, data classes, enums, and utilities required for RFID operations.   
This package does not implement specific business logic but provides unified interfaces and data structure definitions for other RFID implementation packages.

Refer to the [RFID Documentation](https://github.com/RFID-Devs/rfid_flutter_plugin/wiki/RFID-en) for details on the pluginâ€™s interface design and usage if you are unfamiliar with RFID technology and related terminology.

**Important Note: This plugin is designed exclusively for specific pre-adapted hardware environments and is not a universal RFID solution. Unverified devices may not be compatible. Please evaluate carefully before integration.**
